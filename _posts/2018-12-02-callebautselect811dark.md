<h4>Chocolate callets for cooking</h4>

<h4>Cooking experiment</h4>
A few years ago, we previously sampled some apple slices in Calvados, dipped in milk chocolate.
We have the apples and the equipment needed to re-create these.
We used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain-marie" target="_new">Baine-marie</a> to melt the chocolate and a silicon spatula 
(so it doesn't transfer flavour from previous cooking) to stir. We had previously prepared some apple slices, dehydrated with the
[electriQ Dehydrator]({% post_url 2018-12-03-electriqdehydrator %}), which were then rehydrated with Calvados, which we coated in 
the chocolate by dropping them in and mixing with the spatula. The slices were then put onto some grease proof paper and allowed 
to set in the fridge, covered with a bowl to stop the fridge smells from affecting the chocolate.

<h4>Cooking experiment - the result</h4>
The result was surprisingly good! They set hard and shiny. The grease proof paper was textured and left a pattern underneath, so they even looked like they'd been bought from a shop.
Biting into the apple slices made that great crunch sound you expect when eating dark chocolate, 
followed by the explosion of Calvados. I would say that the Calvados was a little strong when 
combined with the <em>dark</em> chocolate coating, and next time I'll be choosing a milk chocolate for
this particular recipe. I would rate my own recipe "good", with the potential to be "very good" when using milk chocolate.

<h4>Other recipes</h4>
They can be transformed easily in chocolate moulds and make a great mousse au chocolate by adding a bit of double / single cream and 2 eggs. 
The mouusse au chocolate is great and perfect texture if you use double cream, beaten of course, with the eggs whites beaten hard.
Needs resting in a fridge for a couple of hours, one night its perfect.


<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>

Callebaut callets are good, rich fruity chocolate, its melting easily and can be transformed into chocolate bonbons without tempering, looks shiny when set.<br />
