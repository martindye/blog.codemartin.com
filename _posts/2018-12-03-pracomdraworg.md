The time had come to tidy up my kitchen draw, which had been a mess for 4 years. A tidy kitchen draw reflects a tidy mind.
Well sorry, that's not true, but it does mean I can quickly grab the item of cutlery I need because it's always in the same
place. This system is far superior to finding a wooden tray which wastes space around the edge. After measuring my draw, I
selected the size to fit the draw within the tolerances specified by Practical Comfort.

When I installed it, it fitted my drawer perfectly. I cleaned and dried the drawer beforehand and the supplied
adhesive pads grip very well, holding the dividers in place very firmly. The aluminium dividers are far superior
and rigid compared to the plasticy offerings from other companies.

<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>

This is really sad, but I opened the kitchen drawer four or five times after I'd installed it, just because it looked so
neat. I think endorphins were released every time I opened the kitchen drawer.

It's expensive, but it is a specialist product, and I don't think you can get anything better unless you pay a
mechanical engineer to craft you something bespoke from a block of solid aluminium on a CNC milling machine.
