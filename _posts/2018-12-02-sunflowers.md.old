I bought this perfume as I had it in the past when a young student and liked very much that time 
as it had a summery fruity fresh scent, more peachy and meloney. I bought it again a few days again but 
it doesn't smell peachy nor melony at all, it has a heavy jasmine or smell that 
dominates the delicate fruity freshy scent more. 
It lasts quite long now, the staying power is pretty good but the scent is not as good, 
its a like a simpler version of what it was and definitely you can't feel the peachy dainty fragrance anymore.

<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>
Still wearable for a low cost everyday perfume but its not very refined and after 40 min it does lose its flowery smell.
