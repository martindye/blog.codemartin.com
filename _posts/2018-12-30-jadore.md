J'adore by Christian Dior 50 ml eau de parfum. As its name suggested J'adore is love once you 
smell it once, it's a timeless fragrance, lingering all day not very strong at opening but developing
on the skin and hair in a sophisticated, feminine, warm scent, not too sweet, just right. I would say it's
powdery-floral, it can be worn day or night, as it's discreet but it reminds you from time to time that's 
its still there. It stays on my skin and hair, like I said, incredibly long if you don't wash it, of course.
Contains essence of ylang-ylang, green apple and Damascus rose.

<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>

This perfume is so refined and sensual that it will always remain lots of women's favourite. If you can afford 
it buy a bottle, the vintage ones were amazingly good in term of staying power.
