Really nice shape and design. They look fabulous when loaded even with desserts that don't look so elegant when seated on a plate, such as apple crumble.

I've used these dessert glasses every 2 days or so for home made trifle or mousse au chocolat. Easy to wash too.

<h6>This mousse au chocolat was for two people to share or one greedy person. It's 2-3 times bigger than a Gü Chocolate Mousse.</h6>

<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>

It's a very good value for money as its a nice glass, plenty big enough.
For the money you can't find better in a high street store as it will be at least £20.

<em>
Note, since this review, the bowls are now sold as a set of 6, so they're still great value for money!
