Really nice shape and design. They look fabulous when loaded even with desserts that don't look so elegant when seated on a plate, such as apple crumble.

I've used these dessert glasses every 2 days or so for home made trifle or mousse au chocolat. Easy to wash too.

<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>

It's a very good value for money as its a nice glass, plenty big enough.
For the money you can't find better in a high street store as it will be at least Â£20.
