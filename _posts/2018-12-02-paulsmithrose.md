Paul Smith is a very nice fresh fragrance that doesn't last very long, 
just a few hours but at least smells very good indeed for the time being.
It's a lovely fragrance only minus is its staying power, not so long as other powdery perfumes.
Usually fresh perfumes don't have the long staying power as the powdery ones as 
[Roberto Cavalli]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-02-robertocavalli %}) or Christian Dior.


<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>
This would have been rated higher if it had longer staying power. 
It's still worth it though as you smell like a garden of fresh cut roses, 
very fresh but not for long, only a few hours.
It's worth buying even though it needs reapplying.
