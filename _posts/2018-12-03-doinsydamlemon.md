I bought this when I was scouring the internet for the best white chocolate with the most cocoa butter. I've tried
quite a few different white chocolates and all too often, they're a bit stingy in the cocoa butter department and
they make up for lack of flavour by adding more suagr. So, eventually I found this one, which has 30% cocoa butter, 
and some interesting flavours in it. I must admit, I somehow didn't see the word "Baobab" when my finger 
feverishly clicked on the "Add to Basket" button.

When I tried a piece, there was a lovely light lemon flavour, poppy seeds and another kind of tangy flavour, and it all
tasted great together. The other tangy flavour was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia">Baobab</a>. It
blends well with the lemon and I possibly would have missed it if I wasn't "listening out" for it with my taste buds.
With the tangy flavours and the poppy seeds it isn't too sweet and you can taste everything including the coacoa
butter.

I bought four bars originally - I <em>was</em> going to give the wife two bars and have two for myself. I'm afraid the
distribution of chocolate rations was <<ahem>> slightly in my favour and I might have accidentally eaten three.

<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>

For white chocolate, this is the one of the tastiest I've had. It's not cheap, but it deserves the gourmet stamp,
and it's totally worth it.

The link below is for the 2 x 80g bars and this offers the best value.
