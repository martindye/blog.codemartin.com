I have destroyed 1 x wok and 1 x non-stick frying pan previously, and rather than cooking up delicious dishes containing bits
of black non-stick particles, I thought I'd get myself a new wok. This time I wanted something that wasn't going to get
destroyed within a year, so I searched for a wok that had a longer lasting non-stick surface. This one has a non-stick surface
reinforced with stainless steel. I noticed that the flat base on the inside is smoother and the sloped walls of the wok
are rougher. I'm not sure if this is by design, but it does kind of grip the food, so you can slide it out the way.

<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>

It's thicker (2mm) than the last wok I had, so heat dissipation is a bit better. I don't know if it's possible to get a thicker
guage steel wok, or with industrial diamonds reinforcing the non-stick coating, but this does the job well and it hasn't
let me down so far (after 10 uses so far).
