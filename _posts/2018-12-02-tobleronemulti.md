This is a selection pack of several different Toblerone bars, as shown below:

<h4>1. Swiss white chocolate with honey and almond nougat</h4>
Tastes creamy, not too sweet, dispite the honey nougat pieces.
The rich choclatey taste of cocoa butter is very noticeable, 
and the overall balance of flavours (nougat, honey, cocoa butter, milk)
means that you can taste each element without any one being overpowering.

<h4>2. Swiss dark chocolate with honey and almond nougat</h4>
This is for dark chocolate lovers. Bitter sweet as you'd expect from a dark chocolate, and not too bitter, as it's balanced with the sweet nougat pieces.

Even with small bits of nougat inside, it's a very rich intense dark chocolate flavour. More for dark chocolate lovers, obviously not so much for kids.

<h4>3. Swiss milk chocolate with honey and almond nougat <em>x2</em></h4>
The classic Toblerone bar: bite into it and find those fab bits of chewy nougat. 

<h4>4. Swiss milk chocolate with raisins and honey and almond nougat</h4>
This is my personal favourite. The raisins add even more to the texture and the flavours work well together.

<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>

Still as good as it ever was, and with the variety, this is a great choccy package. Happy Toblerating!
