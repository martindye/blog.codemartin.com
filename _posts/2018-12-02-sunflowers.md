I bought this perfume as i had it in the past when a young student and liked very much that time 
as it had a summery fruity Fresh scent, more peachy and meloney. I bought it again a few days again but 
it doesn't smell peachy nor melony at all, it has a heavy jasmine or smell that 
destroyed the delicate fruity freshy scent. 
It lasts quite long now, the staying power is pretty good but the scent is not as pleasant, 
its a like a cheap version of what it was and definitely you can't feel the peachy dainty fragrance anymore.

<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>
Still wearable for a cheap everyday perfume but its not very refined and after 40 min it does lose its flowery smell.
