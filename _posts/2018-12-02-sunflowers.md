I bought this perfume as I had it in the past when a young student and liked very much that time 
as it had a summery fruity fresh scent, more peachy and meloney. I bought it again a few days ago and
it has a more pronounced jasmine smell that dominates the delicate fruity freshy scent. 
While the scent is not as refined as it once was, it now lasts quite long now and the staying power is pretty good, 
its a simpler version of what it was.

<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>
Everyday wear perfume (good to wear at work), summery flowery scent, good price for a big bottle so you can reapply.
